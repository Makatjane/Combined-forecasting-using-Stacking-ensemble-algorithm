# Combined-forecasting-using-Stacking-ensemble-algorithm
In this notebook, I developed a combined forecasting model using stacking ensemble algorithm. My base learners are Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The data used to perform this experiment is hourly electricity demand load from ESKOM.
